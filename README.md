# _Project_

Where Is Pulkit started as a personal project to allow family and friends to track my progress on a road trip I took across the country. What it turned into was a way to journal my trip by not only tracking the path I took, but mashing it up with the social services I use to show pictures, checkins, and tweets.My goal is to create an app in which anyone can host their Where Is _INSERT YOUR NAME_, and journal and share their own journeys. And hopefully do it in a way that is natural to how they share their lives online by making it automatic and unobtrusive.

## Project Setup

Dependencies:
- Node.js

As for node libraries, they have been checked into this respository. The reason they are checked in is in the unfortunate case where the NPM repository gets corrupted, this repository will always have a working copy of the library.

Run the project:
1. Open a terminal window and go to the root directory of the code
2. Run 'node app'
3. Open a browser and go to 'http://localhost:3000'

You should see a map be displayed.
